=============

This is a prototype of a game idea drawing some inspiration from

 - factorio
 - TIS-100 & other zachtronics games
 - smalltalk-style reflection

Development
----------

In one shell, you can
```shell
make watch
```
to build the js bundle and in another
```shell
make serve
```
to start a local server on port 8000.

Browse to http://localhost:8000 to play the game.
