=============

This is a prototype of a game idea drawing some inspiration from

 - [factorio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorio)
 - [TIS-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIS-100) & other zachtronics games
 - [Orteil's "Nested"](https://orteil.dashnet.org/nested)
 - [Quadrilateral Cowboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral_Cowboy)
 - [smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk)-style reflection
 - [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html)

Thanks to @dwrensha and @tom7 for ideas.
